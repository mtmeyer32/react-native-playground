# Current Project:
Application to control DirecTV set-top boxes over http via drag and drop GUI.

## MVP:
Control 5 set top boxes with a drap and drop interface. Hard coded library of channels that can be dropped onto tvs to tune the set top box.
(Lots of hard coding for my specific home entertainment setup. Minimal styling. 0 tests or error handling)

## Stretch goals:
1) Proper syling.
2) Error handling and tests.
3) TV Layout Editing in App via drag and drop interface.
4) Automatic channel guide from API
